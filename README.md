# static-bins

A small collection of useful statically linked binaries which I had troubles finding elsewhere.
Currently building with Github Actions, but it is pretty easy to create equivalent Dockerfiles.
Build framework, repo organization and a few recipes are inspired by https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox.
